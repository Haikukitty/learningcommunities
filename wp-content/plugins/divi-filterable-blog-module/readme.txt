> If you have problems after an update, please always try to delete the localStorage first. This ensures that all Page Builder templates are up-to-date after an update. Open the developer tools of your browser, go to "Console" and type in the following command:

    localStorage.clear();

> The answer is "undefined". Then delete your browser cache and try again, maybe in a window in incognito mode.

> IMPORTANT NOTE: Please read before updating!

> Occasionally there were display problems with the settings in the Pagebuilder. This seems to be due to a performance problem. Divi offers with the latest updates a lot of possibilities to customize fonts and buttons. That's great, but it leads to extremely large Page Builder templates when many fonts are used. "Divi - Filterable Blog Module" offers a lot of settings and this should stay that way. However, it is important that everyone can use these great features. That's why this update introduced a second module: "Divi - Filterable Blog Module Light".

> It offers exactly the same possibilities, but the fonts and buttons can only be adjusted with CSS rules in the CSS boxes under the tab "Advanced", or in an external stylesheet. This made it possible to significantly reduce the size of the resulting template and to use it in development environments with lower performance also.

> It is always advisable to try the normal module first. If there are no display problems, it is not necessary to use the "light module".

> Please note that these performance problems only occurred in the backend, where all modules are bound to the templates to configure them in the Page Builder.

* Introduction of the module "Divi - Filterable Blog Module Light", specially designed for development environments with lower performance
* Added 4 new standard layouts: "DFBM-Author-Light", "DFBM-Search-Light", "DFBM-Archive-Light", "DFBM-Shop-Light"
* Added the filter hooks "dfbm_post_meta_before", "dfbm_post_title_before", "dfbm_posts_content_before", "dfbm_posts_content_after", "dfbm_posts_bottom_after". All of them are assigned with the current $post ($post-object) as first parameter, and $featured (bool true/false) as second parameter
* Added a new fade-in animation for the blog post items. It's available in the module settings in the "Layout"-section from the "Content"-tab
* Add the detection of a config file in the child theme used under the path: "/child-theme/includes/dfbm-config.php". An example file is located in the folder "/helper/" and can be easily moved  and adjusted. But you need to change the suffix to ".php". Please follow the instructions on top.
* Added all archive layouts in JSON format to the folder "/helper/layouts/" to have the default settings easily available
* Change from "dfbmTraitGlobals" to "dfbmTraitConstants". This is also only integrated once. As a replacement, the Singleton Pattern function DFBM() is accessed to get constant values
* The updaterscript has been updated
* Fixed a margin-bottom CSS bug for featured posts that was caused by CSS rule changes in the last Divi update
* Fixed a problem where the page variable was calculated wrong when the offset was enabled with the "add more" option
* Fixed a problem where a redirection to the product has occurred in the shop index although the lightbox was switched on
